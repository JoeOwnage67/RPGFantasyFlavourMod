  <VPEH_Hemosage.tooltip>Vampires are powerful, ancient mages that use their connection with an engine of evil and their bloody curse to inflict pain and manipulate matter in vile, wicked ways. Relying on the life drained from others, they instill incredible pain and even worse nightmares. Only those that have access to the power of hemogen can become a true vampire.</VPEH_Hemosage.tooltip>
